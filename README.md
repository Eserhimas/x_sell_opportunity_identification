Cross-Sell Opportunity Identification: Predict customers' needs for additional banking products.

Problem Statement

Financial institutions aim to boost customer value by identifying opportune moments to cross-sell additional products (e.g., savings accounts, investment options, loans). This project develops a predictive model to analyze customer transaction histories and external signals to recommend timely cross-selling interventions.
